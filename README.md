## Project Overview

This repository contains the final capstone project for **CS 620** in collaboration with **Schneider**. The goal of this project is to create a driver‑facing web application that helps owner‑operators and company drivers manage their business by:

- Viewing suggested and confirmed loads and searching for additional loads.
- Tracking profitability through customizable settings such as fuel, maintenance, tire costs and margins.
- Booking loads and confirming appointments.
- Viewing weekly coverage of fixed costs and a running cost per mile (RCM) to understand earnings vs. expenses.
- Viewing a driver portal with performance metrics, wallet information, notices, and leaderboard standings.

The application is split into a **frontend** built with React/TypeScript and a **backend** built with Node.js/Express. **Supabase** is used for authentication and as a database to store user‑specific profitability settings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18 and **npm** (or `pnpm`, `yarn`) installed.
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project. You’ll need a Supabase URL and an API key to enable authentication and persistence of profitability settings.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** and install root dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HongzhengL/Schneider-Casptone.git
   cd Schneider-Casptone
   npm install
   ```

   The repository uses [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) to manage the **backend** and **frontend** packages.

2. **Set environment variables**:

   * Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and adjust values:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     cp .env.example .env
     # Edit .env and set:
     # PORT=4000                          # Port for backend (default 4000)
     # FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173 # URL of the frontend dev server
     # SUPABASE_URL=<your Supabase URL>
     # SUPABASE_KEY=<your Supabase service role key>
     ```

   * Supabase credentials are only required if you wish to enable authentication and the profitability settings API. Without these values the backend runs in “mock” mode and exposes health, load search and other endpoints using in‑memory data.

3. **Set up the database (optional)**:

   To persist profitability settings, create the `profitability_settings` table in Supabase. Run the SQL script located at `sql/profitability-settings-schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor. See `docs/profitability-settings-api.md` for a full description of the API, including authentication requirements, endpoints, expected request/response payloads, error codes and security considerations.

### Running the Application

Open two terminals (one for the backend and one for the frontend).

- **Backend**

  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  The backend will start on the port defined in `backend/.env` (`4000` by default). It exposes REST endpoints under `/api`, including:

  - `GET /api/health` – simple health check.
  - `GET /api/loads/suggested` – suggested loads for the driver home page.
  - `GET /api/loads/find` – find loads with query filters such as distance, revenue, destination and weight.
  - `GET /api/profitability/coverage` – returns a driver’s fixed cost coverage for the current week. The calculation is encapsulated in `backend/src/utils/coverage.js` and can be unit tested with a `referenceDate` query param (see `docs/assumptions.md`).
  - `GET/PUT/POST /api/profitability/settings` – fetch or save the authenticated user’s profitability settings. Authentication is handled via Supabase; see `docs/profitability-settings-api.md`.
  - `GET /api/driver/portal` – returns the driver’s profile, wallet, menu sections, performance summary and app version.
  - Additional endpoints for driver notices, metrics, leaderboard and profiles.

- **Frontend**

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  The frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173` by default. It’s a single‑page application built with **React**, **TypeScript** and **Vite**. Important pages/components include:

  - `HomePage` – shows suggested loads, weekly coverage and quick links.
  - `NoticePage` – displays messages and notices for the driver.
  - `SearchPage` and `FindLoadsResultsPage` – allow the user to search for loads based on filters (distance, RPM, weight, destination, etc.).
  - `LoadDetailPage`, `BookLoadConfirmationPage` and `BookLoadConfirmedPage` – handle the booking workflow.
  - `ProfitabilitySettingsPage` – form for editing profitability settings which persist via the backend API.
  - `LeaderboardPage`, `SettingsPage`, `MorePage` – additional features.

  Authentication and session state are handled via the `AuthContext` using Supabase. The UI uses Radix UI components and Tailwind CSS. Toast notifications are provided by `sonner`.

### Scripts

At the root you can run:

- `npm run format:check` – check formatting using Prettier.
- `npm run format:write` – automatically format code.
- `npm run lint:all` – run ESLint in both workspaces.

Within each workspace you can run `npm run lint` to lint that package, and `npm run test` if tests are added in the future.

## Additional Documentation

- **Assumptions & Design Decisions** – see `docs/assumptions.md` for details on assumptions around fixed cost coverage and how calculations are mocked for demos.
- **Profitability Settings API** – see `docs/profitability-settings-api.md` for a full description of the settings API endpoints, request/response formats and Supabase integration.
